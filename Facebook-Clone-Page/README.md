I started learning HTML and CSS so I decided to make a Project which is to make a Facebook Page with just HTML and CSS. 
So it's a half-ready Facebook Page that has some issues I published that issue in Issues. This is also not responsive, even though I tried so many things to make it responsive
but if anyone knows how to make it responsive can help me!
